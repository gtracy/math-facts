This project lets you practice basic math facts - multiplication and division - via text messages. The test comes in a series of questions and results are stored for later analysis. 

The app uses Twilio for SMS and can be deployed to Google App Engine.

Todo:
- build analytics to help callers know which problems they need more practice on
- expand to addition and subtraction
- implement billing so the SMS cost burden can be shared with caller
- daily reminder notes to users to get them to practice more
